# LorenzTranformers

The Lorenz 63 and 96 models in Mathematics are used for the deterministic chaotic study where the 63 model works on a 3-dimensional ODE and the 96 model works on a 40-dimensional ODE. In this research study, we are implementing the above mathematical model of Lorenz to build a Transformer module to use against the Chicago precipitation dataset to understand and make predictive analysis for climate change behavior.
